# 8086 Assembly Programs

This repository contains a collection of 8086 Assembly Language programs created as part of the **Microprocessor & Assembly Language Programming** course at **Dhaka International University (DIU)**.

## 📚 Description
The programs included here cover various fundamental operations in Assembly, including arithmetic operations, control flow, and logical operations. These codes are written for the **8086 microprocessor** using MASM/TASM assemblers.
